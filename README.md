# Biotracs-openms application

The biotracs-openms application is wrapper of the OpenMS software (https://www.openms.de/). 
OpenMS is an Open-source software for mass spectrometry analysis. Biotracs-openms therefore provides through OpenMS a suite of modules for mass-spectrometry data conversion, filtering, spectra alignment, peak picking, automatic deconvolution and deisotoping, etc.

Biotracs-openms modules can therefore be integrated in the more complex biotracs application to provide complete workflow going from raw data to the analysis of the data and generation of user reports.
